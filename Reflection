3. Reflection on Prompt Iteration / Debugging

During development of the automation prompt, the following improvements were made:

1) Initial Issue:
The model sometimes summarized too briefly or added imaginary details.

Fix:
Added rules:
   -“Do not add details not present in the input.”
   -“Summary must be 3–5 lines.”


2) Initial Issue:
JSON output was inconsistent when data was missing.

Fix:
Added rule:
   -“If data is missing, return null in the JSON.”


3)Initial Issue:
The prompt needed to work for many formats (paragraphs, notes, bullet points).

Fix:
Created a universal output format (Summary → Key Points → JSON).
